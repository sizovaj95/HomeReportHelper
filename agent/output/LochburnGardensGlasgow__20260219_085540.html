It is understood to be overlaid on a modern membrane material. Limited sight was available to any of the roof coverings and there are no roof spaces to inspect due to the roof construction type.
Flat roofs were visually inspected from vantage points within the property and where safe and reasonable to do so from a 3m ladder externally. Flat roofs have a limited life and depending on their age and quality of workmanship can fail at any time. Roofs are prone to water penetration during adverse weather but it is not always possible for surveyors to identify this likelihood in good or dry weather. All roofs should be inspected and repaired by reputable tradesmen on an annual basis and especially after storms.
Rainwater fittings | The rainwater fittings at the property comprise parapet gutters and uPVC gutters, with uPVC downpipes installed throughout. These components are designed to effectively channel rainwater away from the building, helping to protect the structure from water ingress and related damage. Visually inspected.
Main walls | The main walls are believed to be of concrete frame construction with timber framed infill panels clad externally with smooth rendering and timber panelling.
Visually inspected with the aid of binoculars where required. Foundations and concealed parts were not exposed or inspected.
Windows, external doors and joinery | The property features a mix of window types and materials, including windows constructed from both timber and uPVC. The windows are double glazed and include a combination of original and replacement units throughout the property. Random windows were opened and closed where possible.
External doors to the property are of mixed materials, including timber, uPVC, and glazed types. Internal and external doors were opened and closed where keys were available.
External joinery elements, such as soffits and fascias, are made of timber. These components were inspected using binoculars. Visually inspected.
External decorations | The external decorations at the property consist of painted surfaces. The external decorations were visually inspected.
Conservatories / porches | Not applicable.
Communal areas | There is a communal hall and stairwell giving access to all flats within the building. Access is obtained via timber and glazed doors. Circulation areas visually inspected.</pre></div></details></section><section class='field-card'><h3>Potential Problems</h3><div><strong>Status:</strong> not_found</div><div><strong>Value:</strong> Not found</div><div><strong>Found pages:</strong> 18, 19, 20, 21, 23</div><div><strong>Candidate pages:</strong> 18, 19, 20, 21, 23</div><details><summary>Evidence paragraphs</summary><div class='evidence-item'><div><strong>Page 18</strong> | paragraph_id=par_00132</div><pre>2.
